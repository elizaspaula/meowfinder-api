Maine Coons are our focus, we do not breed any other type of animal! We have built a huge 18 foot by 34 foot by 6 feet high outdoor cattery for our Maine Coons to enjoy in good weather.  This outside cattery has separate sleeping areas, jungle gym, toys, tunnels, climbing trees, bean bag chairs, wall perches, hammocks, and more.  It is enclosed in strong steel fencing to keep the Maine Coons safe. We are very proud of our new up and coming cattery and feel honored to share this magnificent breed with others!","image":"https://ibb.co/kgGdNYt","email":"marys@email.com"},{"id":"4c1a2f9c-b7d8-4704-b736-d0dfe692f1fe","user":"elizabete@email.com","catteryName":"Lucas","address":"21st","city":"","province":"Select","breed":"Select","name":"","phone":"","email":"","website":"","facebook":"","picture":["Adam k.JPG","IMG_1615.JPG"],"document":["iStock-480680908.jpg","Herzog cheio.JPG"]},{"id":"58355389-6613-42b1-a263-c73f5afab6e2","user":"elizabete@email.com","catteryName":"Elizabete test","address":"22nd street","city":"Vancouver","province":"British Columbia","breed":"Maine Coon","name":"Elizabete","phone":"778-888-9999","email":"elizabete@email.com","website":"www.website@email.com","facebook":"facebook@email.com","picture":["Cheio rick.JPG","Adam k.JPG","Abertura gente em pé.jpg"],"document":["Certidão casamento atualizada Dani André.pdf","Coffee & Conversations.pdf","2021_895-0-8_895-23-04-2021-17-52-04.pdf"]}]
